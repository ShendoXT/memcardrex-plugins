 About SpyroEdit:
==================

 SpyroEdit is a simple save editor for Spyro the Dragon.
 It allows You to change the number of dragons and gems for each level as well as number of lives.

 Do note that maximum values you can enter are way higher then
 allowed by the game which could lead to unexpected behavior.

 Do not forget to backup your save before editing it.
